# Python Programming Guide

## Introduction
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

## Printing Text
To display text in Python, use the `print()` function:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to Python programming")
```

## Variables
Python uses dynamic typing. You don't need to declare variable types:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.7
```

## Functions
Define functions using the `def` keyword:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

result = greet("Bob")
print(result)  # Outputs: Hello, Bob!
```

## Lists
Lists are ordered collections that can hold items of different types:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Outputs: apple
fruits.append("date")
```

## Summary
Python is beginner-friendly and powerful for various applications including web development, data science, and automation.
