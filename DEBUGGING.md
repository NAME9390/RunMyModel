# Debugging "0 Models Found" Issue

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Backend C++ API is running correctly on `http://localhost:8080`
- API returns 361 models when queried: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/models`
- Frontend builds successfully
- Qt application launches

### ‚ùå What's NOT Working:
- Frontend shows "0 models found" in the UI
- The React app is not successfully fetching models from the backend API

## How to Debug

### Option 1: Chrome Remote Debugging (RECOMMENDED)

The app is now compiled with remote debugging enabled. To see the actual browser console logs:

1. Keep the app running: `./build/RunMyModelDesktop`
2. Open Google Chrome or Chromium
3. Navigate to: `chrome://inspect`
4. Click "inspect" under the RunMyModel Desktop entry
5. Check the Console tab for error messages

Look for messages starting with `[BackendService]` to see what's happening during initialization.

### Option 2: Check API Manually

```bash
# Verify backend is responding
curl http://localhost:8080/api/models | jq '.models | length'

# Should return: 361
```

## Likely Root Causes

### 1. CORS / Mixed Content Issue
**Problem**: Frontend loads from `file://` but tries to fetch from `http://localhost:8080`

**Solution**: We need to either:
- Serve the frontend through the Qt HTTP server instead of loading from file://
- Or configure WebEngine to allow mixed content

### 2. Timing Issue  
**Problem**: Frontend initializes before backend server is ready

**Solution**: Add retry logic or wait for backend to be ready

### 3. LocalStorage/Cache Issue
**Problem**: Old cached data might be interfering

**Solution**:
```javascript
// Clear in Chrome DevTools Console:
localStorage.clear()
location.reload()
```

## Next Steps to Fix

### Approach A: Serve Frontend via HTTP (RECOMMENDED)

Modify the Qt app to serve the React frontend through the HTTP server instead of loading from file://:

1. Update `web_server.cpp` to serve static files from `dist/`
2. Change `main.cpp` to load `http://localhost:8080/` instead of `file://`
3. This eliminates CORS issues entirely

### Approach B: Fix CORS for file:// origin

Add proper CORS headers in `web_server.cpp` to allow `file://` or `null` origin:

```cpp
"Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\r\n"
"Access-Control-Allow-Origin: file://\r\n"  
"Access-Control-Allow-Origin: null\r\n"
```

## Commands for User

```bash
# Run the app
./build/RunMyModelDesktop

# In another terminal, verify backend:
curl http://localhost:8080/api/models | jq '.models[0]'

# Check Qt WebEngine debug output
# Open chrome://inspect in Chrome browser
```

## Console Logs to Look For

In Chrome DevTools, you should see:
```
[BackendService] üöÄ Initializing backend service...
[BackendService] API Base URL: http://localhost:8080/api
[BackendService] Fetching models from: http://localhost:8080/api/models
[BackendService] ‚úÖ Successfully fetched 361 models
```

If you see errors like:
- `CORS policy` - We need to fix CORS headers
- `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` - Backend isn't running
- `Failed to fetch` - Network/CORS issue
